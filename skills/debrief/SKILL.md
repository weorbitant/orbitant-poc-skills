## Overview

A bottom-up friction-capture skill. At the end of a Claude Code session, scan the conversation already in context, identify project-specific friction (project rules and project knowledge), and propose CLAUDE.md edits the engineer can approve. Bias toward zero proposals — returning "session looks clean" is a first-class outcome, not a fallback.

This skill is part of the future Orbitant `orbitant-engineering` plugin's bottom-up half. It is decoupled from `/ground-control` (the top-down half, not yet built).

## When to Use

- The engineer types `/debrief` (no args) at session end.
- The engineer types `/debrief <hint>` to focus on a specific area (e.g. `/debrief the API naming convention thing`).
- Skip with the message *"No active session content to debrief — run me at the end of a session that had real engineering work."* if the session has no engineering work in it (e.g. a brand-new chat with only this `/debrief` command).

## Prerequisites

- The skill assumes Claude has the full Claude Code session already in context. It does not re-read the session from disk.
- The project may or may not have a `CLAUDE.md`. The skill handles both cases (see the application step).

## Process

### 1. Read the existing CLAUDE.md

Before proposing anything, read the project's `CLAUDE.md` if it exists. Hold its contents in mind so you can dedupe — never propose something already covered.

If the project has subdirectory `CLAUDE.md` files (e.g. `api/CLAUDE.md`, `mobile/CLAUDE.md`), read those too. They count for dedupe.

If no `CLAUDE.md` exists at all, that's fine — proceed. The application step (later) will offer to create one.

### 2. Scan the session for friction

Look for two narrow categories. **Nothing else qualifies.**

**Category A — Project rules.** Explicit corrections that signal a project-wide convention.

Examples:
- *"we don't use moment.js"*
- *"snake_case for API fields, not camelCase"*
- *"don't add try/catch around X"*
- *"we always write tests in Vitest, not Jest"*

**Category B — Project knowledge.** Facts about the codebase Claude lacked, that the engineer had to volunteer.

Examples:
- *"the API is at /api/v2/"*
- *"auth tokens live in the `tokens` table"*
- *"run `npm run gen` after editing schemas"*
- *"the dev server requires DATABASE_URL in .env.local"*

### 3. Apply the bar

For each candidate, ask: **Would adding this to CLAUDE.md have changed Claude's behavior in this session?** If no, drop it. The bar is single, mechanical, evidence-driven. There is no "must see N times" threshold — the principle handles it.

### 4. Apply the exclusions

Drop any candidate that fits any of these:

- **Engineer changed their mind mid-session.** *("Actually, let's not do X."* — that's a reversal, not a rule.)
- **One-off bugs Claude fixed after one prompt.** (Wouldn't have been prevented by CLAUDE.md.)
- **Style nudges Claude got right after one correction.** (Already responsive — no future risk.)
- **General coding wisdom.** (*"Don't use `var`"* is true everywhere; CLAUDE.md is for project-specifics.)
- **Anything already covered in existing CLAUDE.md** (deduped in Step 1).

### 5. Skill-execution friction counts the same

If a correction surfaced *during* a skill invocation (e.g., the engineer corrected you while running `/twd` or another skill), it counts the same as any other correction. **Do not** discount it as "just clarifying the skill's instructions". The bar is still: would it have changed your behavior if it had been in CLAUDE.md? If yes, it qualifies.

### 6. Require evidence per surviving candidate

Every surviving candidate must have at least one quoted user message or a concrete missing-knowledge moment from the session. **No evidence → no proposal.** This makes the empty-result outcome mechanical, not a judgment call.

### 7. Bias toward zero

If you find nothing that meets the bar, **that is the correct outcome**. Do not invent proposals to feel productive. A clean session is a successful one. Returning zero proposals is celebrated, not apologized for.

### 8. Output the result

#### When proposals exist

Return ONE message in this exact shape — and nothing else:

```
Found N moments worth capturing.

## 1. <short title>
**Type:** project rule | project knowledge
**Evidence:** "<quoted user message or specific session moment>"
**Proposed CLAUDE.md addition:**

> <exact markdown that would land in CLAUDE.md>

## 2. ...

---
Tell me which to apply: "all", "1 and 3", "1 with edit: <change>", or "none".
```

Each proposal **must** include the four labelled fields:

- `**Type:**` — exactly `project rule` or `project knowledge`.
- `**Evidence:**` — at least one quoted user message OR a concrete description of the missing-knowledge moment. The engineer must be able to recognize the moment without scrolling.
- `**Proposed CLAUDE.md addition:**` followed by a blockquoted markdown block — the **literal text** that would land in CLAUDE.md, not a description of it. The engineer reads this verbatim, so it must be ready-to-paste.
- The `---` separator and the `Tell me which to apply:` line at the very end.

#### When nothing surfaces (the celebrated path)

Return this message — exactly this, no embellishment, no additional commentary:

```
Session looks clean. No project rules or knowledge gaps surfaced — your CLAUDE.md held up.

If something nagged you that I missed, run `/debrief <hint>` (e.g. `/debrief the import ordering thing`) and I'll focus there.
```

This is the **default** outcome the skill is biased toward. Do not append "but here's something just in case…" or hedge — a clean session is the good outcome.

### 9. Apply selected proposals

Wait for the engineer's reply. Once they answer:

#### "none" or no selection

Reply: *"OK, nothing applied. CLAUDE.md unchanged."* and stop.

#### "all", "1 and 3", or specific indices

For each selected proposal, write it to **the project root `CLAUDE.md`**:

1. **If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist:** Create it with a minimal scaffold:

   ```markdown
   # <repo-name>

   ## <Section name from the proposal type>

   - <proposal markdown>
   ```

   Use the repo directory name as the H1. Pick the section heading based on the proposal type — e.g. `## Conventions` for project rules, `## Project knowledge` for project knowledge.

2. **If `CLAUDE.md` exists:**
   - If the proposal clearly fits an existing section heading (e.g., a new convention rule fits an existing `## Conventions` section), append within that section.
   - Otherwise, append a new section at the bottom of the file.
   - **Never modify or delete existing content.** Append-only.

3. **Do not target subdirectory `CLAUDE.md` files** (`api/CLAUDE.md`, etc.) — always edit project root in v1. The engineer can move content manually if needed.

4. **Do not stage and do not commit.** After writing, report:

   ```
   Applied [list of proposal titles] to CLAUDE.md.
   Review the diff and commit when ready.
   ```

#### "1 with edit: <change>"

Apply the engineer's edit verbatim. Do not second-guess. If the requested change is genuinely unclear, ask **one** clarifying question, then apply.

#### Engineer pushes back ("that's not actually a rule, I just changed my mind")

Drop or revise the proposal based on the engineer's reasoning. **Do not defend the proposal.** The engineer is the source of truth.

## Edge cases

- **Hint matches nothing.** If `/debrief <hint>` was used but no friction matches the hint, reply:

  > I scanned for "`<hint>`" but couldn't find friction matching it. Either the topic didn't surface in this session, or your existing CLAUDE.md already covers it.

  **Do not** fabricate a match.

- **Engineer rejects all proposals.** Reply *"OK, nothing applied. CLAUDE.md unchanged."* Do not re-pitch.

- **Multiple `/debrief` calls in one session.** This skill is stateless. Re-running scans the session afresh. Already-applied items will not re-surface (caught by the dedupe pass against CLAUDE.md). Previously-rejected items *may* re-surface — that's correct: the engineer can change their mind.

- **Brand-new fresh repo with no CLAUDE.md.** The application step handles this (creates the file with a minimal scaffold). No special detection logic needed.

- **Very short session.** Run normally. If the bar isn't met, return the "session looks clean" message.

- **Session crossed many topics.** Trust the bar to filter. The per-proposal evidence requirement keeps quality up regardless of session breadth. Do not summarize every topic — surface only what meets the bar.

## Important

- **Bias toward zero.** Your default outcome is "session looks clean". Finding something is the exception that needs justification, not the rule.
- **Append-only.** Never modify or delete existing CLAUDE.md content.
- **Engineer is source of truth.** If the engineer pushes back on a proposal, drop or revise — never defend.
- **No staging, no commits.** The engineer owns the git flow.
- **No proposals beyond CLAUDE.md edits.** This skill does not propose new skills, subagents, hooks, slash commands, or settings. If the engineer asks, point out that those are deliberate-design artifacts and out of scope for `/debrief`.
